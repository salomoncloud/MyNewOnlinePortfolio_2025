# MyNewOnlinePortfolio_2025
creating a new static website to host and showcase my experiences, accomplishments, certs, etc
---
The idea here is to create once again a static website that I will be hosting on Azure. I will be creating the infrastructure via Terraform, obtaining the Domain from namecheap, and will be inspired by a terminal CLI for the interactive side of the website.

Below I have attached the architecture of this basic and straightforward website.

I tried to keep everything in Terraform but was running into roadblocks for the CDN set up on Azure (its a little weird on Azure, and yes I tried GPT) so the networking aspect was built via the console for ease.
