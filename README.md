# MyNewOnlinePortfolio_2025
creating a new static website to host and showcase my experiences, accomplishments, certs, etc

The idea here is to create once again a static website that I will be hosting on Azure. I will be creating the infrastructure via Terraform, obtaining the Domain from namecheap, and will be inspired by a terminal CLI for the interactive side of the website.
